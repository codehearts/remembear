Self-hosted web app for recurring reminders

Remembear was created to manage household chores but can be used for medication reminders, appointment notifications, and anything else occuring on a regular weekly or daily basis!

## Installation

Remembear is still under active development but will be available as a binary and Docker container once released. Until then, you can check out the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/codehearts/remembear/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for steps to build and run remembear locally

## Configuration

Remembear is configured by `remembear.yml` in the directory it's run from. A default configuration file is provided by this repo

### Integrations

Integrations can be configured by defining them in an `integrations` section in `remembear.yml`. To use an integration, `enabled` _must_ be set to `true`:

```yaml
integrations:
  console:
    enabled: true
```
